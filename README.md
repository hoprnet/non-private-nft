## non-private NFT

HOPR non-private NFTs demonstrate the precarious state of privacy in our space by (partially) revealing your IP address and placing it on a leaderboard. Every time we connect our wallet to an RPC provider, we leak data like IP addresses which can be used to link our wallets as well as our online and offline selves.

We believe that increasing awareness about this issue is essential if we are to create a private and secure web3 space.
